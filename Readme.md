##HACKATHON Wild Code Shool
###Best Socket Election web application

In this project, we will build a web application for the Wild Code School Inauguration.
This app will allow wild students to take pictures of guests' sockets and stock these photos in a BDD.

Then, people will access to the public web application in order to vote for the best sockets of the party.
Some rules for this :
- 3 votes max
- no vote for there own socket
